# fitness-app

I created this application to track my progress with various exercises I do during my workouts. The application allows you to enter exercises of your choise as well as datapoints (a date and value) to plot on a line chart, so progress can be easily visualized over time. For the line charts I used the Chart.js graphing library with react-chartjs-2.

Created exercises are stored in the browser's local storage and can also be downloaded as JSON files and reuploaded to restore data. 

The application has a date filter dropdown that allows you to see which exercises were done on the specified date. 

In completing this project I used media queries to make the application look presentable on mobile devices with small screens, allowing for easy referencing of workout data during exercise or when otherwise away from a computer.
